<p>
Mars College is a 3-month program, during which we build <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/chiba/">a temporary village</a> on a 20-acre stretch of open desert in Southern California called <a href="https://mars.college/gallery/desert/">Mars</a>. During this time, we study and incubate projects related to technology and sustainability, and gradually turn camp into a large art installation.

<h2>Mars</h2>

<p>
Mars is a barren landscape with intense sun, frequent cold, and strong wind. It is located on a dry lake bed in the Southern California Desert, next to the Salton Sea.
</p>
<p>
We construct a campus in the open desert with camping areas and academic buildings. We build structures with wood and pallet racks. We set up solar panels for electricity and install a high speed WiFi link to town for internet. We bring water to Mars from town in 5 gallon jugs and IBC tanks.
</p>
<p>
Mars is one mile from a small community with two bar/restaurants and a convenience store. Indio is the closest large town with big grocery stores and hospitals.
</p>

<h3>Shelter</h3>
<p>
Cars, Vans, RVs, Camper trailers and other spaceships make good domiciles on Mars. The more self-contained and self-reliant you are, the more control you have over your welfare and happiness. If you’ve been dreaming about vanlife, Mars College is a good chance to build out a van or cargo trailer into a spaceship of your own.
</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>
There is no public transportation to and from Mars. Many participants come without cars and are generally able to carpool rides into town with other Martians when they need them, including on first arrival.
</p>
<p>
Within Mars College and including town nearby, everything is walking distance. For medium and long distances, many of us have an intense love of electric unicycles. They transform your ability to inhabit an open rural space. We also have some old red beach cruiser bicycles that we can lend.
</p>

<h3>Academic program</h3>

<p>
Mars College has an open calendar where participants schedule classes, activities, and workshops they want to offer. 
</p>
<p>
Some returning alumni have prepared courses with weekly meetings exploring a field and coming up with project ideas.
</p>
<p>
New applicants may select one of those courses to major in or write a plan outlining their goals for an independent study.
</p>

<h3>Structure of the semester</h3>

<p>
The first week of Mars College is an orientation period where people settle into the routine on Mars and help develop the space. During the second week, we have lightning talk sessions for everyone to introduce themselves, share exciting ideas, and propose extracurricular activities and projects.
</p>
<p>
After the lightning talks we open up the calendar for people to add activities and workshops they would like to offer.
</p>
<p>
Courses begin week 3. Typically courses have weekly meetings until the midterm in mid-February. During this time, students are encouraged to explore new ideas and technologies with the aim of choosing a thesis project concept which they present at the midterm.
</p>
<p>
During the second half of the semester, participants develop their thesis projects to present at the final showcase. The showcase is accompanied by a largescale collaborative interactive art installation that is built into the communal structure.
</p>
<p>
People document their work and help breakdown camp during the final week.
</p>

<h3>Courses and Majors</h3>

<p>
The following courses are available for the 2024 semester. More courses may be added later. Some of the courses have additional applications. Please fill those out in addition to the <a href="https://forms.gle/e9yysZdiUHtvht8t8">main application</a>.

Build Week + lightning talks in the evenings
ideas week
Survey - one month of regular meetings to explore the state of the art in a particular area, make simple demos, and formulate a final project idea.
Mid Term - People discuss a bit what they've learned and present their idea for their final project
Project - month where people put together their final project.
Final Show  -->

<!-- Advisors Duties:
Describe Their field of interest, what they will explore during the survey, the types of projects they'd like to see for the final.
Interview people they want to work with during the selection process setting expectations.
Organize the survey meetups. Ideally at least once a week could be more. I was thinking of doing 3-4 times a week and just inviting people to share what they've created or found from the web that was compelling. Maybe simple homework. Really up to the advisor.
Help people define their project
Wrangle people to present for the mid-term.
No strict duties after the midterm.

Possible Advisors:
Freeman
Gene
Vanessa
Anderson
?
Raph  - maybe he'd be into advising a crypto group
Nico
Jmill

Pseudo
Marzipan

I'm open to Street Art / Ceramics / Bio / Math / Yoga  if the advisors want to specifically invite people for these topics and follow this structure.


Work Study
I'm not sure if people coming specifically to work with you on Eden exactly fits this format. Seems like we could also have 'house projects' that we are looking for help with. Maybe to begin with this is just Eden, but could also include 'telepresence', unicycles, building trailers, etc.   For this we'd just make a page describing the project and who we're looking for to participate. Doesn't need to conform to any other structure.


Vision Doc
It would be great if we could pull together a vision doc which describes how we see the metaverse, ai, and crypto tying together in the simulation. Maybe this gows to include the Niland prosperity sphere / Neocity. This feels like something maybe we could pick away at in the blog. Describing bits of it as we have time and clarity that eventually coalesces into a big unified thing.

    <p>
        An open call for the next session will come out in September 2021. Additionally, we are looking for a small number of people to join us early for an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we prepare for the main quarter. Lastly, we have some long-term initiatives for which we are also seeking people to come help us on a more semi-permanent basis, some of which may present opportunities for paid work.

            <li><b>Warm-up period</b>: Dec 2022</li>
            <li><b>Quarter Begins</b>: 2 Jan 2023 </li>
            <li><b>Build + Ideas Week</b>: 2 Jan - 7 Jan 2023 </li>
            <li><b>Mid Term</b>: 17 Feb 2023 </li>
            <li><b>Final Showcase</b>: 31 March - 2 April 2023 </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the quarter, we'll build an <a href="/gallery/off-grid">off-grid</a> village on Mars that we call <a href="/gallery/chiba">Chiba</a>, using low-cost and reusable <a href="/gallery/pallet_racks">building components</a>. We'll setup an electrical grid from <a href="/gallery/solar">solar power</a>, connect to our high-speed internet network in town, and begin a rotation for managing food, water, waste, and composting/gardening. <a href="/work">More info about the work that goes into Mars College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Chiba is built, we spend our time organizing educational and creative activities on Mars and in Bombay Beach, including workshops, study groups, and some invited talks. We also have some meals together, film screenings, <a href="/gallery/yoga">yoga</a>, group bike and <a href="/euc">electric unicycle</a> rides, and other fun stuff. We also setup some communal areas for co-working. <a href="/study">More info about our activities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main quarter culminates in two exhibitions that we organize together, one at the half-way point in mid-February, and a final show at the end of March, coinciding with the <a href="http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/">Bombay Beach Biennale</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the 2022 quarter begins, we will have an informal warm-up period from Nov-Dec 2021, during which we are looking for a small number of people to come early and help us prepare for the 2022 quarter. During this time, we are smaller, more informal, and mostly focused on infrastructure projects and preparing the build on Mars.
